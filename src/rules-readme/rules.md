Pushed rolls in Call of Cthulhu. Basically if you fail a skill check, you can try again, but only if you can describe a new way to do it that carries more risk.

Example: an investigator is trying to break into a house through a 1st floor window. They fail their initial strength check, as the window is painted shut. Now they push the roll by attempting to kick the window in. They fail that too, and now the sound of breaking glass has attracted a nosy neighbor.

I like this rule because it ratchets up tension by driving the players to take risks. And it solves a problem a lot of RPGs have where failing a course of action causes the game to stall and lose momentum.
